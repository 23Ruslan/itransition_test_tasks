Language: JavaScript or TypeScript or anything you like.
Calculate SHA3-256 for every file from archive (https://www.dropbox.com/s/oy2668zp1lsuseh/task2.zip?dl=1). Note, files are binary, you don’t need encodings — if you read file to string with some encoding, you have to use the same encoding to decode string into bytes for hashing (there is a technical term for such conversions “stupid activity”).
Write hashes as 64 hex digits in lower case.
Sort hashes as strings.
Join sorted hashes without any separator.
Concatenate resulted string with your e-mail.
Find the SHA3-256 of the result string.
Send obtained 64 hex digits in the lower case
